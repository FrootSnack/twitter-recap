# Twitter Replay
Nolan Welch and David Foss's submission for HackNC 2021. Read the project write-up [here](https://devpost.com/software/twitter-replay)!

This website offers a way to "replay" Twitter trends that relate to a given streamer. Users may input a link to a VOD and will be shown a list of Twitter trends that occurred during the livestream that included Tweets that often made reference to the streamer.
